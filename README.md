# When to Use Other Languages

*If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.* - Abraham Maslow

**Dude, you did it. You've got Javascript in the bag. NICE. But wait! There's more!**

You can do a lot with Javascript nowadays. With frameworks like [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) for frontend development and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) for backend development, a working knowledge of Javascript goes further than ever before. But, contrary to what some JS enthusiasts may tell you, JS is not the de facto right call for everything. 

In the following scenarios, talk about which languages you think would be most appropriate (Read: Pick a language(s) and explain your reasoning). Remember, there is no one right answer and some answers are more right than others. All that matters is that you can justify your choice with sound reasoning.

**Scenario 1: Trendsetter**
A young man sulks into your office and slouches down in a chair. With his head braced on his index finger, he breaks the melodramatic silence: "InstaSnap: Photosharing. With filters." You stare back blankly, dithering on whether or not to feign enthusiasm. As you deliberate, he looks askance at the Android phone on your desk. You see an eyebrow raise above his black Wayfarers. *"Oh. Is that... your phone? InstaSnap is iPhone only."* His smug expression contorts into perplexity as he asks, *"What programming languages should I use?"*

**Scenario 2: Startup Guy**
Jacked up on 5 Hr Energy, a grey hoodie-clad young man walks into your office with an idea for the next big social network: a microblogging service where users can make posts no longer than 10 characters *all in emojis*. The soon-to-be founder describes how he will need to build a frontend website and backend web server before Tourettically interrupting himself to exclaim "but MOBILE FIRST". He pedantically enumerates on the mobile platforms his game-changing startup will support: *iOS, Android, and even* ... he stares wild-eyed down at his shoes and swallows before naming the final one *even Windows Mobile*. You shutter. *A madman*. He regains his composure and looks up at you in a moment of lucidity to ask "What programming languages should I use?"
